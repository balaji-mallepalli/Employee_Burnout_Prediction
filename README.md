# Employee Burnout Prediction 🔥

This project predicts employee burnout using machine learning techniques. It analyzes various employee-related features (like mental fatigue, workload, and resource availability) to determine the risk of burnout. The goal is to help organizations identify and mitigate burnout in the workplace.

## 🧠 Objective

To build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether an employee is at risk of burnout, based on historical data and psychological indicators.

## 📌 Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and visualization
- Model building using various ML algorithms
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.
- Predictive insights for HR intervention

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for EDA and visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for model building and evaluation)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Model Evaluation

- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

Different algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) can be compared for performance.

## 📝 Output

- Predicts whether an employee is likely to experience burnout (`Yes`/`No`)
- Helps HR departments in proactive planning
- Insights visualized using plots and graphs
